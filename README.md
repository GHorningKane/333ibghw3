## MVC and REST API Explanation
MVC is a way to organize an app: the model holds the data and rules, the view shows it to the user, and the controller takes orders from the user and tells the model and view what to do.

The REST API is what allows the software to communicate. Clients use HTTP methods to interact with resources by sending requests to specific endpoints which the server can then respond to. This helps applications work together more easily.
